        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 1:</strong> Course introduction and web dev 101</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>In class today I introduced myself to the students and gave them a primer on what we'll cover in MSC2006. Following intros and hellos, we dove into an explanation of web development, or web dev, at a basic level. Specficially, we covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basics of HTML, inclduing it's syntax and how to get a simple version of this nifty little site up and running</li>
				<li>Coverd the difference between server and client machines, as well as a robust web dev "lexicon" of useful terms</li>
				<li>Began a conversation regarding what interactive technologies are needed for our MRPs, and around how important it is to get started learning them</li>
			</ul>

        <!--Week 2-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 2:</strong> Web dev 202 and intro to accessible design</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>Today's lecture built upon the foundation we set in web dev 101. We dove deeper into CSS syntax and stlying, and explored creating subpages within a website folder structure. After a tutorial on using Figma designs for CSS code, we covered a recap of accessible design to bolster what students learned in the fall. Specifically, we covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basics of CSS, inclduing it's syntax and how to do basic stlying manually</li>
				<li>How to turn a wireframe into a Figma prototype that can inform your CSS coding</li>
				<li>The main characteristics of accessible design (i.e., POUR) and some small scale case studies (inlcuding our own websites!)</li>
			</ul>

        <!--Week 3-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 3:</strong> Previsualization for linear media</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>This class was a mixed lecture and media lab. We began by discussing the MRP/technology experiment assignment before diving into the actual topic of the day. Then, student's were given a breif overview of the pre-visualization process for linear media using a simplifed workflow for animations, with a heavy focus on the power and utility of storyboards. Once the basic process was introduced, folks were tasked with reverse engineering a set of storyboards and answering some questions general questions about the linear previz process. This is all a set-up for next week, where we'll explore how linear previz intersect with and differs from previz in non-linear media.</p>
