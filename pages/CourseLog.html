            <!--Week 1-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 1:</strong> Course introduction and web dev 101</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>In class today I introduced myself to the students and gave them a primer on what we'll cover in MSC2006. Following intros and hellos, we dove into an explanation of web development, or web dev, at a basic level. Specficially, we covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basics of HTML, inclduing it's syntax and how to get a simple version of this nifty little site up and running</li>
				<li>Coverd the difference between server and client machines, as well as a robust web dev "lexicon" of useful terms</li>
				<li>Began a conversation regarding what interactive technologies are needed for our MRPs, and around how important it is to get started learning them</li>
			</ul>

        <!--Week 2-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 2:</strong> Web dev 202 and intro to accessible design</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>Today's lecture built upon the foundation we set in web dev 101. We dove deeper into CSS syntax and stlying, and explored creating subpages within a website folder structure. After a tutorial on using Figma designs for CSS code, we covered a recap of accessible design to bolster what students learned in the fall. Specifically, we covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basics of CSS, inclduing it's syntax and how to do basic stlying manually</li>
				<li>How to turn a wireframe into a Figma prototype that can inform your CSS coding</li>
				<li>The main characteristics of accessible design (i.e., POUR) and some small scale case studies (inlcuding our own websites!)</li>
			</ul>

        <!--Week 3-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 3:</strong> Previsualization for linear media</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>This class was a mixed lecture and media lab. We began by discussing the MRP/technology experiment assignment before diving into the actual topic of the day. Then, student's were given a breif overview of the pre-visualization process for linear media using a simplifed workflow for animations, with a heavy focus on the power and utility of storyboards. Once the basic process was introduced, folks were tasked with reverse engineering a set of storyboards and answering some questions general questions about the linear previz process. This is all a set-up for next week, where we'll explore how linear previz intersect with and differs from previz in non-linear media.</p>
		</div>

        <!--Week 4-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 4:</strong> Previsualization for non-linear media</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>This class began with a quick web dev review quiz on quercus. However, after fnishing that we continued building on our previsulaization discussion from the week prior, taking a critical look at how the previs process for interactive or non-linear media is similar to and different from previs for animations, etc. We covered some examples in class, using relevant references from the Osso VR production process and more traditional game dev studios. After the lecture, students completed a media lab where they reverse engineered storybaords for two video game sequences — a Pokémon battle and a short train escape sequence from Uncharted 2. </p>
            <p>At the end of class, student self-organized into groups for their interactive project, sharing initial ideas regarding topics and technology in preparation for more formal pitches next week.</p>

        <!--Week 5-->
        <button class="accordian"><strong>Week 5:</strong> Group project pitches, scrollytelling 101, and review period
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>We had an exciting start to class this week, as students pitched their proposed interactive projects to the class. We have three groups in total, two focusing on scrollytelling stories and one focusing on n AR application. Overall, the projects are striking a great balance between ambitious, informative, and interesting — so I'm quite excited to see how they progress.</p>
            <p>Following the project pitches, I provided a breif lecture on scrollytelling, and a quick review on web dev content based on the results of the quiz. Once complete, students worked on a scrollytelling media lab in class, followed by some time to work within their project groups.</p>
